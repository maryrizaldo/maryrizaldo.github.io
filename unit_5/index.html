<h1>Hello. Please enter THRESHOLD</h1>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>My name is Mary R. and I am a  junior architect in New York City, but more importantly I am a curious citizen of the world with a desire to understand both the familiar and unfamiliar surrounding we live in. I want to share with you all what I have discovered from my travels here in - THRESHOLD.</p>
<p>What is a Threshold?</p>
<p>In architectural jargon, we often used the term threshold in a technical detail in a seemingly almost way. But, even the smallest of details can make the difference for the experiencing your space and surrounding. But threshold can also be defined in a more generally as a point of entry or beginning.</p>
<p>Point of Entry</p>
<p>Enter how I see the world thru my amateur lens. I will do my best to tell you stories thru a series of images accompanied with stories of my experiences.</p>
