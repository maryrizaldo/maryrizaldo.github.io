<h2>Who am I? </h2>
<p>My name is Mary Rizaldo and I am a  junior architect in New York City, but more importantly I am a curious citizen of the world with a desire to understand both familiar and unfamiliar surrounding we live in. I want to share with you all what I have learned from my travels here in - THRESHOLD.</p> 

<h2>What is Threshold?</h2> 
<p>In architectural jargon, we often used the term threshold in a technical detail in a seemingly almost banal way. But, even the smallest of details can make the difference for the experiencing your space and surrounding. But threshold can also be defined in a more generally as a point of entry or beginning. Here, we will define threshold as a point of entry or beginning.</p>

<h2>My Point of Entries</h2>
<p>Enter how I see the world thru my amateur lens. I will do my best to tell you stories thru a series of images accompanied with stories of my experiences.</p>
